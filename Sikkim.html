                            <li><p>The most interesting thing about this lake is the fact that it never freezes completely. The lake is the primary source of water for the locals. There is a religious belief around this lake that explains this phenomenon. Hindu’s and Buddhists and Sikhs come together to consider this lake to be a sacred place.</p></li>
                            <li><p>It is believed that while Guru Padmasambhava was on his way back from Tibet, the locals had pleaded for a solution to their perennial problem of water. He was moved by their pleadings and had touched a part of the lake that never freezes and is also considered sacred.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Several locals believe in the fact that drinking this water could resolve fertility issues of women. This is not a scientifically proven fact and hence it makes sense not to drink the water without knowing much. There is also a temple next to the lake where tourists can offer prayers.</p></li>

                         <li><p>Imagine a negative temperature along with a wind speed of 15kms per hour. It is extremely windy and that makes the place feel a lot more freezing than the temperature itself. Wind speed keeps going up as the day passes by. It is believed that afternoon wind in near the Lake can even lift stones.</p></li>
                         <li><p>If you are fond of colourful flowers and have been longing to see wildflowers in bloom, then the best time to visit the Lake and the surrounding areas is from April – May.</p></li>
