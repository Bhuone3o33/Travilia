There are various temples and pilgrimage sites all over India but, this one stands out. “Unakoti” is a collection of enormous bas-relief carvings on the side of the rocky hills.</p></li>
                         <li><p>The archaeologists are not clear about the formation of the carvings on the rock. Legend has it that, once upon a time, Lord Shiva was going to Kashi hills along with one crore Gods and Goddesses.  They stopped by at the Raghunandan hills for some rest.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Shiva ordered the Gods and Goddesses to wake up before sunrise and proceed for Kashi hills. On the next morning, Lord Shiva found no one awake except, himself. Out of anger, Shiva cursed all the asleep gods and goddesses to remain as a stone forever. As a result, the formation of one less than a crore stones occurred in the hills. Thus, it was named “Unakoti”.</p></li>
                         <li><p>The Unakoti hills are a hub for spectacle monkeys and a variety of birds. On the top, there is a shrine for Shiva and Vishnu. A variety of carved stone sculptures accumulate in a cave-like small house. Lord Shiva is believed to be the creator of magical rocks.</p></li>
                         <li><p>The bas-relief sculptures of  Unakoti are the largest ones in India. The style of carving depicts that, they were created centuries ago. The images of Shiva are 30 feet tall. One can also find Durga, Ganesha, Vishnu, Hanuman and Ravana images sculpt all around the hills.</p></li>
